# 100 Days of Code Challenge in Python 

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code Challenge repository! Here, I'll be documenting my 100-day coding journey in Python. The goal is simple: to code in Python for at least an hour each day and explore a wide range of topics, including web development, data science, web scraping, Python scripting, game development, web design, automation, API integration, and GUI development. 

## What to Expect 

- **Daily Code:** Each day, I'll commit code related to the topics I'm exploring.
- **Progress Tracking:** I'll keep track of my progress, challenges, and learnings throughout the journey.
- **Learning Resources:** I'll share the resources and courses I'm using, including the fantastic Python Bootcamp by Angela Yu.
- **Community:** I encourage fellow coders to join me on this journey. Share your insights, challenges, and code snippets. Let's learn and grow together!

**Start Date:** 03 Nov, 2023 

Let's connect, learn, and code together! Feel free to explore the code and provide feedback. If you have questions or want to collaborate, don't hesitate to reach out. 

Happy coding! üêç
