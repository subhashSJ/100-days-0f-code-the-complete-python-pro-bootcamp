   - Examples of while loop usage in coding exercises.

4. Conditional Statements:
   - Overview of conditional statements (if, elif, else) and their role in decision-making.
   - Practical examples of conditional statements.

5. Interactive Coding on 'Reebor's World':
   - A brief description of the 'Reebor's World' coding platform.
   - Challenges completed on the platform using loops, functions, and conditional statements.
